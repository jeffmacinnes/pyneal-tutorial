# Pyneal Tutorials

This repository contains a set of tutorials to accompany the [**Pyneal**](https://github.com/jeffmacinnes/pyneal) real-time fMRI software package. For more information on Pyneal, please see [**Pyneal Docs**](https://jeffmacinnes.github.io/pyneal-docs/). 

The purpose of these tutorials is to:

* get users familiar with the standard workflow of using Pyneal
* implement and test the full Pyneal pipeline using representative environments of GE, Siemens, and Philips brand scanners.  
* demonstrate how to run a real-time analyis using both built-in and custom tools. 


## Full Pipeline Tutorial
[**FullPipelineTutorial.md**](FullPipelineTutorial.md)

This respository contains representative data from GE, Siemens, and Philips scanning environments. For a detailed, step-by-step walk-through on setting up and running Pyneal across each of these environments, please see link above.

## Analysis Tutorial
[**AnalysisTutorial.md**](AnalysisTutorial.md)

One of the main uses for Pyneal is to run experiments that rely on real-time analysis of on-going fMRI scans. Pyneal presents users mulitple options for implementing real-time analyses, including standard ROI averaging as well as the option to develop fully customized analysis routines. This repository provides a sample dataset, and gives users a walkthrough on using Pyneal's built-in analysis tools as well as writing and implementing a custom analysis script.
